													 Image Slider

									This is a simple image slider implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Run

To run the image slider, follow these steps:

1. Download/Clone Repository: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open HTML File: Navigate to the folder containing the `index.html` file in your file explorer.

3. Open in a Web Browser: Right-click on `index.html` and open it with a web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).

4. Slider Usage: Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through the images manually. The slider also has an automatic slideshow that transitions to the next image every 3 seconds.

## Customization

You can customize the image slider by:

- Adding Images: Replace the image paths in the JavaScript array (`images`) with your desired image URLs or paths.

- Styling: Modify the CSS styles in the <style> tag inside the HTML file to change the appearance of the slider, buttons, or images.

## Notes

- Ensure a stable internet connection to load external images from URLs.
- Make sure the images used are appropriately sized to fit the slider.

## Example Images

Here are some example images you can use for testing:

- `image1.jpg`
- `image2.jpg`
- `image3.jpg`
- `image4.jpg`
- `image5.jpg`

Instead of image1,image2 and others, you can give other images paths or Online image URL's.
